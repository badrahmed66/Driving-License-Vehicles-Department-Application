# Newer .NET Core / .NET 5+ style package cache
# This is usually located in a global user directory, but sometimes can be local.
# If you are using PackageReference in your project files, 'obj/' handles this.
# However, if you are still using packages.config, this might be needed.
# For most modern projects, 'obj/' takes care of it.
# You can uncomment this if you find a 'packages' folder still being generated
# in your project root or subdirectories outside of 'obj/'.
